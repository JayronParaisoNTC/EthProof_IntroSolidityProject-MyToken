# Project Title: MyToken

## Description:
MyToken is a basic implementation of a token contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the creation, tracking, and transfer of tokens. The contract includes functions to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens. The token name is set to "Meta" with the abbreviation "MTA".

## Getting Started:
To use the MyToken contract, you need to have access to an Ethereum development environment or a compatible blockchain network. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Install an Ethereum development environment such as Remix or set up a local blockchain network like Ganache.
2. Deploy the MyToken contract on the Ethereum network of your choice.
3. Interact with the contract using a compatible wallet or a smart contract interaction tool like Remix or Web3.js.

## Executing Program:
Once the contract is deployed and you have a means to interact with it, you can perform the following actions:

1. Mint Tokens: Use the `mint` function to create new tokens. Provide the address where the tokens should be credited and the amount to be added. The total supply and the balance of the specified address will be updated accordingly.

2. Burn Tokens: Utilize the `burn` function to destroy existing tokens. Specify the address from which tokens should be burned and the amount to be subtracted. The total supply and the balance of the specified address will be adjusted if the address has a sufficient token balance.
